# declare and initialize a list of nodes
list targetList = {1}

# conditional attack statement (starts at 100 and it refers nodes in targetList)
from 100 nodes in targetList do {

	# packet filter, it filters all packets having the field 'sourcePort' of the layer 'NET' equals to 1000 OR 2000
	filter("NET.sourcePort" == "1000|2000" and "NET.destinationPort" == 2000 or "NET.destinationPort" == 10 or "NET.destinationPort" == 122)
		
		# drop the (original) intercepted packet
		drop(original, 1)
