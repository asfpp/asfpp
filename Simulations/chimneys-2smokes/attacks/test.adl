#
# technique: attack based on wormhole.
#
# brief: Exchange cluster-1's data with cluster-2's data.
#
# detail: Node 3 and node 4 (compromised) establish a wormhole
#         between them.
#         Packets received by node 4 from node 6 are tampered and are  
#         sent through the wormhole to node 3. The latter sends the 
#         packets to the sink.
#         In the same way, packets received by node 3 from node 5 are
#         tampered and sent through the wormhole to node 4.
