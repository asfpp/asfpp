Techinque
---------
Attack against the routing mechanism carried out by injecting fake packets
into the network.


Brief
-----
The objective of the attack is to tamper data regarding pollutant emissions
of cluster-1 and cluster-2.


Detail
------
+ Attacking cluster-1
The attacker periodically injects fake RREP and HELLO packets. The fake
packets are sent to the node-5 and appear to come from the node-4.
In this way the node-5, which is the cluster head of the cluster-1, sets
(and keeps) the node-4 as its next-hop in the path to reach the sink node.
However the node-4 and the node-5 are too far apart, and the one can't 
physically reach the other.
By doing so, cluster-1 is isolated from the network because all the data 
packets sent by node-5 to node-4 are lost.

Once the cluster-1 is isolated, the attacker injects fake data packets  
into the network in order to tamper data about cluster-1's emissions.
The fake data packets appear to come from the node-5.

+ Attacking cluster-2
To alter the data concerning the emissions of pollutant from cluster-2, 
the attacker injects into the network fake data packets with a certain
rate. The fake data packets seem to come from node-6, which is the 
cluster head of the cluster-2.
To compute the emission of pollutant from cluster-2, the sink node uses 
both original and fake data.
The attack becomes more effective as the injection rate increases.
