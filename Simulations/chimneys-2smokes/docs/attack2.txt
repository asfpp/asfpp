Techinque
---------
Cyber-physical attack carried out by removing a node and by injecting 
fake packets into the network.


Brief
-----
The objective of the attack is to tamper data regarding pollutant emissions
of cluster-1 and cluster-2.


Detail
------
+ Attacking cluster-1
The attacker removes the node-3 from the network with the aim of isolating 
the cluster-1.
Then he periodically injects fake HELLO messages. The fake HELLO messages 
are sent to the node-5 and appear to come from the node-3.
In this way the node-5, which is the cluster head of the cluster-1, keeps 
the path alive. By doing so the node-5 sends the data packets throught 
a dead path, so all the original data packets are definitively lost.

Once the cluster-1 is isolated, the attacker injects fake data packets  
into the network in order to tamper data about cluster-1's emissions.
The fake data packets appear to come from the node-5.

+ Attacking cluster-2
To alter the data concerning the emissions of pollutant from cluster-2, 
the attacker injects into the network fake data packets with a certain
rate. The fake data packets seem to come from node-6, which is the 
cluster head of the cluster-2.
To compute the emission of pollutant from cluster-2, the sink node uses 
both original and fake data.
The attack becomes more effective as the injection rate increases.
