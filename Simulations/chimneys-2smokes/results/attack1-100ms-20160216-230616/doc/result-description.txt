The plot shows the behavior of the monitoring system under the attack 
'attack1-250ms'.

Threshold
---------
The threshold is set to 35 µg/m^3.

Smokestack-1
------------
The attack begins at 175.
The original packets coming from cluster-1 are lost due to the attack.
The attacker injects fake data packets and brings the reported emissions 
above the threshold (from about 30 µg/m^3 to about 40 µg/m^3).

Smokestack-2
------
The attack begins at 175.
The attacker injects a fake data packet every 100 ms.
By using this injection rate, the attacker brings the reported emissions 
around the threshold (from about 44 µg/m^3 to about 28 µg/m^3).
