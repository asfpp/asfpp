/*
 * This action can have differents behaviour, and is meaningful only for conditional attacks, i.e. on LocalFilter modules.
 * 
 * Intercepted packets: delay packet delivery to the next layer in the TX/RX flow (there is
 * no delay by default). Such packets are always either sent to the next layer or discarded.
 * 
 * Created/cloned packets: send the packet to the next layer in the TX/RX flow, possibly specifying a delivery delay.
